The project is divided into two main milestones, each with detailed steps to ensure a comprehensive and secure network setup.

## ✅ Milestone 1: Network Infrastructure Setup and Configuration

### Network Design and Beautification
- **Network Design and Beautification**: Establish a structured and visually organized network layout.

### Basic Connectivity and Switching
- **Basic Settings to All Devices**: Apply essential settings to all network devices for basic connectivity.
- **VLANs for Wired, Wireless & Voice Assignment**: Design and assign VLANs for various network segments.
- **STP Portfast and BPDUguard Configurations**: Strengthen network stability with STP enhancements.
- **EtherChannel**: Employ EtherChannel and LACP for increased network link aggregation.

### Routing and High Availability
- **Subnetting and IP Addressing**: Optimize IP address allocation through efficient subnetting.
- **HSRP and Inter-VLAN Routing**: Configure HSRP for high availability and set up routing between VLANs.

## Milestone 2: Advanced Services and Security Enhancement

### Security and Access Control
- **Static IP Address to DMZ/Server Farm Devices**: Secure DMZ and server farms with static IP addressing.
- **DHCP Server Device Configurations**: Automate IP assignment with DHCP.
- **OSPF on the Firewall, Routers, and Switches**: Implement OSPF for effective internal routing.
- **Firewall Interface Security Zones and Levels**: Define and enforce security perimeters within the network.
- **Firewall Inspection Policy Configuration**: Establish policies for traffic inspection on firewalls.
- **Standard ACL for SSH**: Restrict SSH access using Standard ACLs.

### Advanced Networking Features
- **Wireless Network Configurations**: Deploy a robust wireless infrastructure.
- **Telephony Service Configuration**: Set up and configure network telephony services.

### External Services Integration and Security
- **VPN Connections**: Establish VPN connections for secure remote access.
- **Cloud Integration**: Integrate with cloud services like AWS for external resource accessibility.
- **Security Policy Implementation**: Define and implement security policies for traffic regulation.

### Verification and Documentation
- **Verifying and Testing Configurations**: Ensure network performance and security through rigorous testing and verification.

This README serves as a roadmap for the project, detailing each step involved in the creation of a secure and functional information network.
